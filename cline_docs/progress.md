# Progress

## What Works
- The ECHONET Lite application is functional and can discover and control devices
- The alias command functionality is fully implemented
  - Users can create, view, delete, and list aliases for devices in memory
  - Documentation for the alias command is complete in both PrintUsage and README.md
  - Aliases are persisted to disk in aliases.json
- The DeviceAliases.go file has SaveToFile and LoadFromFile methods implemented
- ECHONETLiteHandler.go calls SaveToFile after alias operations to persist aliases to disk
- LoadFromFile is called at startup to load saved aliases

## What's Left to Build
- All planned features for the current development cycle have been implemented
